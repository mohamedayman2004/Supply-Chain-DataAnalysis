# Supply-Chain-DataAnalysis

## Overview
This project is focused on analyzing supply chain data to gain insights into various aspects such as product availability, pricing, shipping times, and supplier performance. The data is stored in a CSV file and includes information on different product types, SKUs, prices, availability, and other relevant metrics.

   git clone https://github.com/mohamedayman2004/Supply-Chain-DataAnalysis.git
   cd Supply-Chain-DataAnalysis

## Usage
To analyze the supply chain data, you can use various data analysis tools and techniques. Here are some steps you can follow:
1. Load the dataset into a data analysis tool (e.g., Python, R, Excel).
2. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
3. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and identify patterns.
4. Apply statistical and machine learning models to gain insights and make predictions.
5. Visualize the results using charts and graphs.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To analyze the supply chain data and identify key metrics.
- To understand the performance of different suppliers and shipping carriers.
- To gain insights into customer demographics and their purchasing behavior.
- To optimize the supply chain process and reduce costs.
